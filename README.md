# Plugin Command runner
This mod is used to run commands sent from a proxy.
To make this mod work, you must specify the name of the server so that it can receive the correct messages/commands.

It has a built-in mod dependency:

The only change I have made to the dependency is the communication channel, as it clashed with a different mod.
